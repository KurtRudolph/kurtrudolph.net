## Tell me about yourself?
Well, I graduated from U of I from the college of engineering.  
I started my own business.  And I have been been picking up contract 
work ever since.  I really don't see my self as someone who show up to a 9 to 5 job.  
I'm someone who pours every I have into what I do. 

I'm very passionate about programming and the possibilities of 
how computing may bring people together.  Working largely alone, I recently decided 


## What has been your greatest achievement?

Becoming a software developer.  Growing up I was an epileptic, and the combination 
of often being hospitalized for my condition and a learning disability similar to dyslexia 
I found self in remedial classes throughout my grammar and high school career.  
I was always good at math but the first class which really clicked for me was Computer Science 
my Junior year of high school.  

I had finally found something that just felt right and I told my self there and then 
"I'm going to build software for the rest of my life."
  It’s been a long and difficult path overcoming the barriers of my learning disability and getting to where I am today but I’ve since graduated from a top 5 CS school, love what I do, and feel like I’m only just beginning to realize what I’m capable of doing.
