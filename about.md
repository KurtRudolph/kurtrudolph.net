# Projects

* [Web-Frameworks-for-Mobile-App-Development](https://vimeo.com/35998909) - A screen cast I made breaking down the basics of Ruby on Rails, jQuery Mobile, and PhoneGap. And a demonstration where I build a blog app combining the three with a little PhoneGap hack to make the app apear native.  [Github repo](https://github.com/KurtRudolph/Web-Frameworks-for-Mobile-App-Development).
* [Alternative High Performance Benchmarks](http://kurtrudolph.net/2012/10/11/alternative-high-performance-benchmarks/) - 
A project submitted to the [2011 Supper Computing conference](12).
The poster was featured in the PGAS section of the conference and 
basically argues for further exploration of PGAS languages for 
alternative HPC benchmarks, specifically, a [UPC](13) implementation 
of the [Graph 500](11). [Github repo](https://github.com/KurtRudolph/PGAS_SC11).
* [CudaMP](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqjs0WxgRF0) - A Message Passing Interface (MPI)-like protocol for Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) developed by my senior project team. The video is the application of the project performing the rasterization of the 3d-view OpenKinect project yielding slightly faster results than OpenGL [Formal paper](https://github.com/KurtRudolph/CudaMP/raw/master/Paper/CS493-RockwellCollins-FinalPaper.pdf).  [Github repo](https://github.com/KurtRudolph/CudaMP).
* [SnakeCube](https://github.com/rudolph9/SnakeCube) - Validates a [snake cube](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_cube) in several different languages.
* [Shopsense-Ruby](http://rudycomputing.github.io/shopsense-ruby/) - A gem I wrote the wraps up the [ShopSense Api](https://shopsense.shopstyle.com/page/ShopSenseHome).
* [Rooted-Nook](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIOlqsswecI) - Rooted my nook touch to yield a full featured android tablet with an e-ink display.
* [Combustion Emissions Testing Devices](https://github.com/RudyComputing/CombustionEmissionsTesting) - Building off the Linux based RaspberryPi board and working closely with data acquisition hardware designers, developed software to aggregate and analyse the data of the sensory devices.  The devices were used to test stoves in rural China.
* [microAeth-AE51-Ruby](https://github.com/RudyComputing/microAeth-AE51-Ruby) - A gem I wrote to interface with the proprietary AethLabs microAeth&reg; model AE51 testing device.
* [RudyComputing.io](http://www.rudycomputing.io/) - My company website I built using Rails and Bootstrap.
* [Backbone.js AdminPanel](http://pure-refuge-1784.herokuapp.com/) - A basic AdminPanel build with Backbone.js and Rails.
* [Christmas Stool](http://imgur.com/a/5kWk9) - The stools I made for each of my nieces and nephews
