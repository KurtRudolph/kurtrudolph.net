## Tell me about yourself?
Well, I graduated from U of I from the college of engineering.  
I started my own business.  And I have been been picking up contract 
work ever since.  I really don't see my self as someone who show up to a 9 to 5 job.  
I'm someone who pours every I have into what I do. 

I'm very passionate about programming and the possibilities of 
how computing may bring people together.  Working largely alone though
I've found my self rather isolated and have recently decided to 
pursue more conventional career opportunities.

## How do you go about solving a problem?
I work toward finding a solution.  I don't like to over think things.  
Although problems are often complex, generally they are able to be broken down into 
more manageable tasks.  Combining the straightforward solutions to these manageable tasks,
is how I go about solving a problem.


## What has been your greatest achievement?

Becoming a software developer.  Growing up I was an epileptic, and the combination 
of often being hospitalized for my condition and a learning disability similar to dyslexia 
I found self in remedial classes throughout my grammar and high school career.  
I was always good at math but the first class which really clicked for me was Computer Science 
my Junior year of high school.  I had finally found something that just felt right 
and I told my self there and then  "I'm going to build software for the rest of my life."

It's been a long and difficult path getting to where I am today.  
But, I've graduated from a top 5 CS school, love what I do, 
and feel like I'm only just beginning to realize what I'm capable of.

# What is your greatest weaknesses?
Communication, coming from a very technical background 
I often find it difficult to effectively articulate my thoughts.  
But, this is something I have focused intensely on over the last year.  Although 
I am still improving, I have made tremendous strides.  

For example, when someone asks what I do my response is "I build software", an open ended response 
generally followed by additional questions.  Depending on the follow up questions
I tailor my continued responses accordingly.  By initially responding in a more open ended manor, I am able
speak in a context suited to the person I am communicating with.

Dynamically responding to questions is one of many techniques I employ.  While communication is likely still my greatest weakness,
I believe it is something I can always improve.

## What are your strengths?
Looking at things in a unique manner.  I don't process information like most people.  
I am unique in that regard and although it contributes to my weakness in communication, 
it enables to me to find unique solutions to problems others likely wouldn't have thought of.

Without getting into to many programming technical details, one example is I don't use a mouse.  
Via a set of keyboard combinations I am able to turn the home row keys into arrows keys directing the mouse and 
the space-bar, left command, and right keys into the middle, left, and right clicking keys.  In turn I never have 
to remove my hands from the home row and in turn more efficient at developing software.


## What are your hobbies / tell me something interesting about yourself?
I'm a really good cook, I'm famous for my Chili.  My secrete ingredient 
is Italian dressing.
  
I love running! I trained competitively high school and since have made it part of a more leisurely exercise routine. 
  
I am a big fan of music and occasionally attend concerts and shows.

## What is a situation where the manor in which you built something carried over and negatively effected you there after?
