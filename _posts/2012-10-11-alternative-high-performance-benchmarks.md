The following is a project to the [2011 Supper Computing conference](2).  
The poster  was featured in the PGAS section of the conference and 
basically argues for further exploration of PGAS languages for 
alternative HPC benchmarks, specifically, a [UPC](3) implementation 
of the [Graph 500](1).

The poster was made using latex and all source can be found [here](5).
