Finding balance between contentment and achievement is difficult.
It is often said life is about balance but finding this particular 
balance is recursive in nature and require a unique approach.


Classifying one's current standing as unsatisfactory, 
often people derive unhealthy motivation and use this as 
the basis of their actions.
Whether this be the continued pursual of one's goals or
the abandonment of one's goals entirely, current standing
should not serve as the basis of people's actions.
Rather, consider an approach based on the _rate_ at which 
one is achieving goals.
