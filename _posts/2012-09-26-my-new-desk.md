Being 6'2'' and software developer don't always mix well.
Cursed by terrible back pain throughout my college career,
I continuously altered my desktop setup to be more ergonomically
correct, visited chiropractors, and took more ibuprofen than
any person should.

Recently, I constructed a new desk, one which 
gravity would encourage proper ergonomics rather than work
against them.
