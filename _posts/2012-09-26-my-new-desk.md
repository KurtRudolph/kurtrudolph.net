Being 6'2'' and software developer do not generally mix well.
The world made largely for people who are about 5'8'' [_no_ pun intended],
many taller people who spend extended periods of time on computer suffer 
from terrible back pain, my self included.

Personally, my back issues related to spending extended periods of time on
a computer hindered many parts of my life.  I did not address the issue 
lying down though [pun _intended_] as I have actively worked toward addressing
the issue.  I have invested a great deal of time and money into the altered 
my desk; mounting monitors, purchasing a more supportive chair, raising the height
of the desk, along with many other things intended to enable more conducive
usage of my computer accordingly to my bodies physical configuration.

Most recently, I constructed a new desk.  One which gravity encourages
proper ergonomics, rather than working against them...

      A computer configuration which allows for usage while lying on 
      your back.  The computer configuration is made up of _1)_ a yoga 
      mat _2)_ a wall mounted monitor _3)_ and wireless keyboard.
      The computer configuration is designed to promote proper posture.

In combination with an accessibility application allowing usage of mouse functionality
via the keyboard ([keyremap4macbook](http://pqrs.org/macosx/keyremap4macbook/)), the 
computer configuration allows one to work while lying on their back.

Using the configuration for going on 4 months now, I find the majority of my back issues
alleviated.  Being a cross country runner some years ago, I often tried to begin
running on a regular basis again but continuously found my self hindered by sharp 
pains in my upper back.  Now going on a month, I have found my self in a regular 
distance-running/exercise routine and while my legs are sore my the miles I find
the back issues which previously hindered me are hardily noticeable.


Promising technology for future improvements includes mind controlled such at [this]
(http://people.ece.cornell.edu/land/courses/ece4760/FinalProjects/s2012/cwm55/cwm55_mj294/index.html#)
and the rapidly improving minimizing/portability of high resolution monitors.  As an initial configuration 
the setup serves it's purposes well, but looking forward to the future, one can only wonder how wonder how 
we may better incorporate continually evolving computer accessibility technology into our lives and better
enable people as a whole to grow and prosper.
