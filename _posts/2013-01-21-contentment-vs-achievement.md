Finding balance between contentment and achievement is difficult.
It is often said "life is about balance" but finding this particular 
balance is recursive in nature and requires a unique approach.


Classifying one's current standing as unsatisfactory, 
often people derive unhealthy motivation and use this as 
the basis of their actions.
Whether this be the continued pursual of one's goals or
the abandonment of one's goals entirely, current standing alone
should not serve as the basis of anyone's actions.
Rather, consider an approach based on the _rate_ at which 
one is achieving one's goals.

Differentiating one's achievements with respect to their occurrence 
during one's lifetime, a more representative approach to determining
contentment in one's life is found.  Similar to the scientific 
definition of [position][0], a more representative approach to determining
if an object's position will be in a desired location is found looking at
its [velocity][1].  

Recursively applying this approach, found is one's [acceleration][2],
one's [jerk][3], one's [jounce][4], ...  While discerning if one will
achieve one's goals is an [undecidable problem][5], most things in life
are.  Moving forward with this in mind all one can do is take what is 
known and make informed decisions on how to proceed next.
